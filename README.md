# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


### To run this app
* Open [Matt's GitHub web page](http://mattr777.github.io/ "Matt's GitHub Page") with a web browser.
* A feed reader app will run with Jasmine test results at the bottom of the page. All specs should pass.
